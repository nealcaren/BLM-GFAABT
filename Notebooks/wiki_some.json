The crowd was overwhelmingly young, with most of the protesters being white along with some black and Asian protesters as well. City councilmember John D'Amico was among the protesters. The demonstrators marched west from the intersection of Santa Monica Boulevard and La Cienega Boulevard to reach San Vincente Boulevard. From there, the protesters turned to face the West Hollywood's Sheriff's Station. The crowd chanted \u201cWhat do we want? Justice! When do we want it? Now!\u201d, \u201cProsecute Killer Cops\u201d, and \u201cI Can\u2019t Breathe.\u201d The protesters also kneeled for 8 minutes and 46 seconds to commemorate the time that Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin kneeled on George Floyd's neck, killing him in the process.","references":["https:\/\/www.alhambrasource.org\/story\/protests-death-george-floyd-support-black-lives-matter-curfew","https:\/\/thecatalinaislander.com\/avalon-shows-support-for-george-floyd-protests\/","https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/michael.ponce.9279\/posts\/2759875977472473","https:\/\/losangeles.cbslocal.com\/2020\/05\/30\/hundreds-gather-in-fairfax-district-as-part-of-latest-protest-over-deadly-arrest-of-george-floyd\/","https:\/\/www.nbclosangeles.com\/news\/local\/beverly-hills-city-council-holds-emergency-meeting-in-response-to-protests\/2371167\/","https:\/\/wwd.com\/fashion-news\/fashion-scoops\/looting-of-luxury-retail-begins-in-l-a-amid-george-floyd-protests-1203644223\/","https:\/\/www.wbur.org\/hereandnow\/2020\/06\/08\/los-angeles-cross-racial-protests","https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/2020\/06\/04\/burbank-protest-draws-hundreds-exceeds-organizers-expectations\/","https:\/\/patch.com\/california\/calabasas\/enough-hundreds-march-justice-calabasas","https:\/\/www.nbclosangeles.com\/news\/local\/protests-los-angeles-george-floyd-justice-police-marches\/2375892\/","http:\/\/lmlamplighter.com\/hundreds-attend-floyd-protests-in-cerritos\/","https:\/\/www.claremont-courier.com\/articles\/news\/t37511-protest","https:\/\/www.foxla.com\/video\/692408","https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/2020\/06\/05\/300-plus-culver-city-demonstrators-call-for-justice-amid-week-of-george-floyd-protests\/","https:\/\/www.latimes.com\/california\/story\/2020-05-29\/protesters-outraged-over-george-floyd-death-shut-down-101-freeway-in-san-jose","https:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/us\/live-news\/george-floyd-protests-05-30-20\/h_bed8d49b7f61868628d1a4466ca5b91c","https:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/us\/live-news\/george-floyd-protests-05-31-20\/h_a1c52a63ba8182b0d9fd28c5a709e31c","https:\/\/www.thedailybeast.com\/los-angeles-police-officer-put-in-chokehold-and-kicked-as-anti-police-brutality-protests-turned-violent","https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/dozens-arrested-in-downtown-los-angeles-tuesday-night-after-day-of-peaceful-protests","https:\/\/www.presstelegram.com\/hundreds-gather-for-george-floyd-inspired-march-in-downey","https:\/\/www.sgvtribune.com\/2020\/06\/04\/hundreds-gather-in-diamond-bar-to-protest-police-violence-honor-george-floyd\/","https:\/\/abc7.com\/diamond-bar-protest-black-lives-matter-pepper-balls-shot-george-floyd\/6232607\/","https:\/\/heavy.com\/news\/2020\/06\/el-monte-protests-all-lives-matter\/","https:\/\/laist.com\/2020\/05\/30\/los-angeles-george-floyd-protests-day-four.php","https:\/\/losangeles.cbslocal.com\/2020\/05\/30\/hundreds-gather-in-fairfax-district-as-part-of-latest-protest-over-deadly-arrest-of-george-floyd\/","https:\/\/abc7.com\/6231194\/","https:\/\/www.dailybulletin.com\/2020\/06\/01\/over-100-protest-the-death-of-george-floyd-in-glendora\/","https:\/\/losangeles.cbslocal.com\/video\/4575151-protestors-chant-defund-the-police-outside-of-mayor-eric-garcettis-home-in-hancock-park\/","https:\/\/www.crescentavalleyweekly.com\/news\/05\/31\/2020\/la-canada-holds-protest\/","https:\/\/www.montrosepress.com\/news\/residents-gather-in-montrose-for-second-day-of-protests-of-floyd-killing-racial-injustice\/article_a59ac394-a5b2-11ea-a400-938d2a91d6bd.html","https:\/\/www.montrosepress.com\/news\/hundreds-gather-for-walk-of-solidarity-protest-in-montrose-on-saturday\/article_a71e9514-a83d-11ea-b176-3f969a207051.html","https:\/\/www.sgvtribune.com\/curbside-protest-underway-in-la-puente","https:\/\/www.dailybulletin.com\/hundreds-demand-change-in-la-verne-after-death-of-george-floyd","https:\/\/ktla.com\/news\/local-news\/deputies-deploy-pepper-ball-rounds-smoke-as-lakewood-protest-ends-in-very-ugly-way\/","https:\/\/www.latimes.com\/california\/story\/2020-05-31\/long-beach-mall-looters-protesters-pike-outlets","https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/2020\/06\/06\/500-plus-attend-manhattan-beachs-burst-the-bubble-on-racism-protest-for-kids\/","https:\/\/www.whittierdailynews.com\/montebello-turns-out-in-protest-of-george-floyds-death","https:\/\/www.monroviaweekly.com\/news\/monrovia-youth-peacefully-protest-at-library-park-and-march-on-myrtle-ave\/","https:\/\/www.avpress.com\/news\/protesters-march-in-palmdale\/article_217f57bc-a3b6-11ea-9201-4b6c525dfb27.html","https:\/\/www.dailybreeze.com\/2020\/06\/01\/young-people-families-in-palos-verdes-estate-protest-police-violence\/","https:\/\/www.pasadenanow.com\/main\/demonstrators-protesting-death-of-george-floyd-descend-on-old-pasadena\/","https:\/\/www.capitalgazette.com\/news\/ac-cn-pasadena-protest-20200606-bvzuoeaehfh5ddpasukyqbfbge-story.html","https:\/\/www.dailybulletin.com\/about-250-protest-george-floyd-killing-in-pomona","https:\/\/www.dailybreeze.com\/dozens-gather-in-redondo-beach-wednesday-afternoon-to-demand-justice-for-george-floyd","https:\/\/tbrnews.com\/news\/more-than-200-protest-police-brutality-in-redondo-beachs-miramar-park\/article_8e3cf27a-a770-11ea-9463-47e30afd853b.html","http:\/\/www.uscannenbergmedia.com\/2020\/06\/10\/residents-of-the-r

By 3:30\u00a0p.m., hundreds were marching north, with some protesters reportedly throwing fireworks and bottles near officers. Some also tagged buildings, cars, and a bus shelter. Another group of protesters climbed on top of a 151 Sheridan CTA bus. Demonstrators gathered on three sides of a police vehicle that was backing up on Dearborn Street, and confrontations broke out between officers and protesters when a police car tried to drive down Monroe Street in the Loop. By 4\u00a0p.m., the crowd had split into several groups heading in different directions, including Trump Tower, where it became markedly chaotic, with some throwing bottles and fireworks at officers. Authorities pushed protesters out of the way of a police vehicle. Along State Street, marchers heading northbound chanted \"Black Lives Matter\" and \"I Can't Breathe,\" most of them wearing masks and many holding signs that read \"Defund the Police\" and \"Justice for Floyd.\" On the Magnificent Mile, a demonstrator wore a mobile stereo around his neck as the song \"Fight the Power\" by Public Enemy played from it. Simultaneously, church bells rang from the Fourth Presbyterian Church. Protesters marched on Lake Shore Drive and Michigan Avenue, and the crowd began to enter the outer drive through a northbound entrance ramp. By 5\u00a0p.m., officers had responded to at least one dozen \"10-1\" calls, a police emergency. Some demonstrators reportedly tried to overturn a police car; others tried to hop onto another CTA bus. The Ohio and Ontario feeder ramps were closed by authorities as well as the ramps leading to Eisenhower Expressway (I-290). Additionally, the CTA temporarily suspended Red Line service between the Clark\/Division and Sox-35th stations.","references":["https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/article\/george-floyd-protests-timeline.html","https:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/us\/live-news\/george-floyd-protests-05-30-20\/h_de1a9e57b9e107fff57400171334482e","https:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/us\/live-news\/george-floyd-protests-05-30-20\/h_b637b27db1ffcdf12fe23d818ef8cd49","https:\/\/www.nbcchicago.com\/news\/local\/squad-cars-damaged-protesters-struck-with-batons-in-chicago\/2280686\/","https:\/\/www.chicagotribune.com\/news\/breaking\/ct-loop-protests-property-damage-20200530-ncvxjtwglnfoddlyj4yuhd6lwm-story.html","https:\/\/chicago.suntimes.com\/2020\/5\/30\/21275417\/loop-protesters-arrested-clashes-chicago-police-george-floyd-state-harrison","https:\/\/www.nbcchicago.com\/news\/local\/squad-cars-damaged-protesters-struck-with-batons-in-chicago\/2280686\/","https:\/\/www.nbcchicago.com\/news\/local\/squad-cars-damaged-protesters-struck-with-batons-in-chicago\/2280686\/","https:\/\/www.wbez.org\/stories\/mayor-lightfoot-announces-9-pm-curfew-as-downtown-protests-escalate\/422b5c47-2e92-4d03-98b4-2f11971c42e1","https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2020\/05\/27\/us\/gallery\/george-floyd-demonstrations\/index.html","https:\/\/abc7chicago.com\/6222518\/","https:\/\/chicago.suntimes.com\/crime\/2020\/5\/31\/21275962\/downtown-loop-river-north-shootings-gun-violence-george-floyd-protests-hubbard-michigan-jackson","https:\/\/www.chicagotribune.com\/news\/breaking\/ct-loop-protests-property-damage-20200530-ncvxjtwglnfoddlyj4yuhd6lwm-story.html","https:\/\/chicago.suntimes.com\/crime\/2020\/5\/31\/21275962\/downtown-loop-river-north-shootings-gun-violence-george-floyd-protests-hubbard-michigan-jackson","https:\/\/abc7chicago.com\/6222518\/","https:\/\/www.nbcchicago.com\/news\/local\/macys-zara-nike-and-more-major-downtown-stores-damaged-during-chicago-protests\/2280878\/","https:\/\/www.chicagotribune.com\/news\/breaking\/ct-loop-protests-property-damage-20200530-ncvxjtwglnfoddlyj4yuhd6lwm-story.html","https:\/\/www.nbcchicago.com\/news\/local\/macys-zara-nike-and-more-major-downtown-stores-damaged-during-chicago-protests\/2280878\/","https:\/\/chicago.suntimes.com\/crime\/2020\/5\/31\/21275962\/downtown-loop-river-north-shootings-gun-violence-george-floyd-protests-hubbard-michigan-jackson","https:\/\/abc7chicago.com\/6222518\/","https:\/\/abc7chicago.com\/6222518\/","https:\/\/abc7chicago.com\/6222518\/","https:\/\/chicago.suntimes.com\/news\/2020\/5\/31\/21276051\/lightfoot-limits-access-loop-curfew-protest-riots-chicago"],"state":"Chicago"},{"city":"May 31","text":"Warning sent to smartphones regarding a temporary suspension of CTA services on the night of May 31, 2020.

Protesters shouted, threw water bottles, eggs, shoes, and rocks, and launched fireworks into lines of police, while officers, mounted police, and SWAT used pepper spray, rubber and wooden pellets, flashbangs to drive them back. Some protesters threw the pepper spray back at police officers. Some tore trash cans and mailboxes from their mountings. Around 11:30, protesters used trash cans to smash the Statehouse's windows, and attempted to enter through its High Street doors (locked to the public for years). One person managed to enter the state auditor's ceremonial office through a window, though they left as soon as state troops arrived, and was arrested outside the building. Two lamps, over a century old, had their glass smashed, which may be difficult to replace. Small flags for forgotten soldiers on the east side of the building were set on fire; the remaining ones were brought inside by a Statehouse grounds crew. 28 Statehouse windows were shattered on May 28, along with the west doors, five pole lamps, some granite, and a bench. .mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbinner{display:flex;flex-direction:column}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .trow{display:flex;flex-direction:row;clear:left;flex-wrap:wrap;width:100%;box-sizing:border-box}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .tsingle{margin:1px;float:left}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .theader{clear:both;font-weight:bold;text-align:center;align-self:center;background-color:transparent;width:100%}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbcaption{text-align:left;background-color:transparent}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbcaption-center{text-align:center;background-color:transparent}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .text-align-left{text-align:left}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .text-align-right{text-align:right}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .text-align-center{text-align:center}@media all and (max-width:720px){.mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbinner{width:100%!important;box-sizing:border-box;max-width:none!important;align-items:center}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .trow{justify-content:center}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .tsingle{float:none!important;max-width:100%!important;box-sizing:border-box;text-align:center}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbcaption{text-align:center}} May 30 protests: in the Short North At the Statehouse At Broad and High In the morning of May 30, business owners began to clean up their vandalized businesses.

As well, several protests and marches involved temporary street closures. The city's local public transit agency, the Central Ohio Transit Authority (COTA), stopped all service through downtown on May 30 through at least June 6. Service was rerouted given a Columbus Division of Police emergency established on every downtown street, banning COTA from using the downtown streets for public transit, despite most protests only taking place on High Street and Capitol Square. The service changes affect 14 active bus routes (discounting routes stopped due to COVID-19 ridership decreases).

The Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) blocked the interchanges into the city along I-5, I-84, I-405, and U.S. Route 26.

Metro, which operates the venue, said, \"Our venues are located in areas with deep legacies of racial injustices and we support peaceful demonstrations to stand together to dismantle systemic racism and hatred.\" Additionally, the OCC's executive director said the venue \"is an economic driver for our state and the spires have become as much of a staple in the skyline at the White Stag on Burnside.
