The protestors were attempting to get onto the interstate (Interstate 10), which is near a tunnel with high traffic volume and high speeds.  Our law enforcement agency supports peaceful protests. It is also equally our duty to ensure the safety of protestors.  Allowing the protestors onto the interstate would have placed them in harm's way. It would have impeded the flow of traffic where protestors and motorists could have gotten injured. In this situation, the potential loss of life outweighed the risk of deploying gas. \ Charlette M.
