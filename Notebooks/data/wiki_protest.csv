Green Bay,"On the evening of May 30 and the afternoon of May 31, there were peaceful protests held in downtown Green Bay. However, on the evening of the 31st, a Marathon gas station was looted, and several shots were fired. The police began firing rubber pellets at the protesters, at which point, the crowd began throwing rocks at the police. Police dispersed the crowd with gas. The crowds were so big that the intended path for the protest, walking from Leicht Memorial Park to the Green Bay Police Department, needed to be scrapped. Organizers stated that activists from groups that were not previously familiar with one another united as a form of grieving and solidarity in the hope to achieve wide-scale police reform. The protest was completely peaceful, with no arrests or incidents of looting and vandalism reported. Activists later took to City Hall looking to remove a curfew put in by Green Bay police, mayor Eric Genrich and the majority of city council members; the curfew was set to curb looting and vandalism that had occurred at times from previous protests.",Wisconsin,"['https://fox11online.com/news/local/green-bay/people-march-through-downtown-green-bay-streets-in-support-of-justice-for-george-floyd', 'https://www.wbay.com/content/news/Protesters-return-to-downtown-Green-Bay-570907211.html', 'https://www.greenbaypressgazette.com/story/news/2020/06/09/george-floyd-green-bay-activists-organize-historical-protest-2-500/5318678002/']"
