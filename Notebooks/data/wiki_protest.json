By 3:30\u00a0p.m., hundreds were marching north, with some protesters reportedly throwing fireworks and bottles near officers. Some also tagged buildings, cars, and a bus shelter. Another group of protesters climbed on top of a 151 Sheridan CTA bus. Demonstrators gathered on three sides of a police vehicle that was backing up on Dearborn Street, and confrontations broke out between officers and protesters when a police car tried to drive down Monroe Street in the Loop. By 4\u00a0p.m., the crowd had split into several groups heading in different directions, including Trump Tower, where it became markedly chaotic, with some throwing bottles and fireworks at officers. Authorities pushed protesters out of the way of a police vehicle. Along State Street, marchers heading northbound chanted \"Black Lives Matter\" and \"I Can't Breathe,\" most of them wearing masks and many holding signs that read \"Defund the Police\" and \"Justice for Floyd.\" On the Magnificent Mile, a demonstrator wore a mobile stereo around his neck as the song \"Fight the Power\" by Public Enemy played from it. Simultaneously, church bells rang from the Fourth Presbyterian Church. Protesters marched on Lake Shore Drive and Michigan Avenue, and the crowd began to enter the outer drive through a northbound entrance ramp. By 5\u00a0p.m., officers had responded to at least one dozen \"10-1\" calls, a police emergency. Some demonstrators reportedly tried to overturn a police car; others tried to hop onto another CTA bus. The Ohio and Ontario feeder ramps were closed by authorities as well as the ramps leading to Eisenhower Expressway (I-290).
